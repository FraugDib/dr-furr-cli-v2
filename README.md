### Fair Launch Sniping Tools
#### Availability
Uniswap SushiSwap PancakeSwap ApeSwap QuickSwap SpookySwap SpiritSwap KoffeeSwap KuSwap Trader Joe

#### Telegram Scanner
Listens and scans for new messages within the targeted Telegram group or channel for contract address, and automatically execute transaction as soon as a match is detected.
Our custom filtering and sensitivity system automatically determine if a message sent is a contract address; whether if it is sent as swap link, or the contract address itself.
The Telegram Scanner can also filter contract address sent hidden in media file, and sent separated in parts (e.g. A + C), both single or multiple message.
Messages from popular Telegram bots such as MissRose are automatically filtered out, so you don't have to worry that you buy from Scammers with CA in their names.

#### Manual Input Address

In scenarios where you already have the contract address, you can set pending orders with Manual Input Address, and as soon as the liquidity has been added, or trading has been enabled, DRFURR-CLI will execute the transaction.

### CoinMarketCap/CoinGecko Sniper
#### Fastest Alerts Telegram

Snipe listings as soon as it is posted to the CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko Fastest Alerts Telegram channel.
This works as a continuous loop, and it will only snipe listings with Red Circled (received insider info) and with BNB as its primary liquidity.
You can also configure the minimum and maximum liquidity/tax for the snipe, so you won't be buying into something with already 1500 BNB in liquidity, and hoping for a 2x.
All the standard transactional configuration will be used, except for the RUG_PULL_CHECK and SELL_MANAGEMENT option.
